# Developer Instructions

## General Guidelines

### AI-Assisted Development

- **Use AI for development** but make sure you understand code generated by AI.
  - Always review and comprehend AI-generated code before committing
  - Test AI-generated code thoroughly
  - Refactor if needed to match project standards and patterns
  - Ask questions if any part of the generated code is unclear

## Branch Management

### Milestone Branches

- I have created separate branch for each milestone. Make sure to work on specific branch for working on a milestone.
  - Each milestone has its own dedicated branch
  - Do not mix work from different milestones in the same branch
  - Check which milestone branch you're on before starting work

### Keeping Branches Up to Date

- **Before working on milestone branch**, make sure that you rebase on top of main branch so everything is up to date with main branch.
  ```bash
  git fetch
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout <milestone-branch>
  git rebase main
  ```
  
  **Note:** Always run `git fetch` first to get the latest branch information from the remote repository before checking out the milestone branch.

## Pull Requests

### Reviewers

- When you push and create pull request, make sure to put me as a reviewer (MUST).
  - Always add the project maintainer as a required reviewer
  - Do not merge without review approval

### GitHub Progress Tracking

- **Keep the corresponding project in GitHub up to date with progress.**
  - Update project boards, milestones, or issues as you make progress
  - Link pull requests to their corresponding milestones/issues
  - Include pull request links in milestone/issue descriptions or comments
  - Update issue status (In Progress, Review, Done) as work progresses

**Best Practices:**
- When creating a pull request, reference the milestone or issue number in the PR description
  - Example: `Closes #42` or `Related to Milestone 2`
- Add the PR link to the corresponding milestone/issue for easy tracking
- Update milestone/issue status when PR is created, reviewed, or merged
- Keep project boards synchronized with actual development progress

**Example PR Description:**
```
## Description
Implements JWT authentication utilities for Milestone 4.

## Changes
- Add JWT token creation and validation functions
- Implement password hashing utilities
- Add authentication service layer

## Related
- Milestone 4: Authentication & Security
- Closes #42
- Related to #43, #44
```

## Commit Messages

### Commit Message Standards

- The commit messages should be very descriptive and clear.
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add user authentication endpoint" not "Added user authentication endpoint")
  - Include context about what changed and why
  - Reference issue numbers if applicable
  - Keep the first line under 72 characters
  - Add detailed description for complex changes

**Good Examples:**
```
feat: Implement JWT token generation utility

Add create_access_token function in app/core/security.py with
configurable expiration time and secret key from settings.

Closes #42
```

```
docs: Update API v1 README with authentication examples

Add code examples showing how to use protected endpoints
with JWT tokens.
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
fix stuff
```
```
update
```
```
changes
```

## Development Workflow

### Regular Commits

- You should have regular commits during your development of milestone.
  - Commit frequently (at least once per logical unit of work)
  - Don't wait until the entire milestone is complete
  - Each commit should represent a working, testable state
  - Use feature branches within milestone branches if needed for complex features

### Documentation Updates

- Do not forget to update readme files for each important section with updates you have made.
  - Update module README.md files when adding new functionality
  - Update `/docs` folder documentation when architecture changes
  - Keep examples in README files current with code changes
  - Document any new patterns or conventions introduced

**When to Update Documentation:**
- Adding new modules or features
- Changing existing APIs or interfaces
- Introducing new patterns or conventions
- Fixing bugs that affect documented behavior
- Adding new dependencies or configuration options
